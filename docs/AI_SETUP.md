## Performance & Cost Optimization

### Rate Limiting
- Default: 60 API calls per minute to OpenAI
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Caching results to avoid duplicate analyses

### Cost Management
- AI analyses are cached for 1 hour by default
- Batch operations process multiple items efficiently
- Use confidence thresholds to avoid unnecessary re-analysis

### Monitoring
- Track AI model performance in the database
- Monitor accuracy and confidence scores
- Review and adjust AI suggestions based on feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Key Invalid**
```bash
Error: Invalid API key
Solution: Check your OPENAI_API_KEY in .env.local
```

2. **Database Tables Missing**
```bash
Error: Table 'AI_Analysis' doesn't exist
Solution: Run the migration SQL file
```

3. **Rate Limit Exceeded**
```bash
Error: Rate limit exceeded
Solution: Reduce AI_RATE_LIMIT or upgrade OpenAI plan
```

4. **Low Confidence Scores**
```bash
Issue: AI confidence consistently below 70%
Solution: Provide more detailed invoice descriptions and client data
```

### Debug Mode
Enable AI debugging by adding to `.env.local`:
```bash
AI_DEBUG="true"
```

This will log detailed AI request/response information.

## Integration Examples

### Automatic Categorization on Invoice Creation
```typescript
// In your invoice creation handler
const categorization = await AIService.categorizeInvoice({
  description: invoiceData.description,
  amount: invoiceData.total,
  clientName: client.name,
  items: invoiceData.items
});

// Update invoice with AI results
await prisma.invoices.update({
  where: { id: invoiceId },
  data: {
    category: categorization.category,
    subcategory: categorization.subcategory,
    tags: categorization.tags.join(','),
    ai_confidence: categorization.confidence
  }
});
```

### Scheduled Follow-up Analysis
```typescript
// Run daily to identify clients needing follow-up
const clientsNeedingAttention = await prisma.clients.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { last_contact_date: { lt: new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) } },
      { invoices: { some: { status: 'overdue' } } }
    ]
  }
});

for (const client of clientsNeedingAttention) {
  const suggestion = await AIService.generateFollowUpSuggestions(client);
  // Store or act on suggestions
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Model Updates**: Review AI suggestions weekly and provide feedback
2. **Data Quality**: Ensure invoice descriptions and client data are detailed
3. **Human Oversight**: Always review high-impact AI recommendations
4. **Continuous Learning**: Use confidence scores to improve data quality
